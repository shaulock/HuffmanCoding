# HuffmanCoding

This Project is an implementation of Huffman Compression in Python.

The aim is to create a program written in Python, fully, that will compress a text file using the Huffman Compression technique, while also incorporating certain tweeks, that can significantly increase the compression rate. (Like using multiple words as one entity, for example)

It is a group project developed by 3 people. It is assigned as the final project for the Programming module of our undergraduate studies.
